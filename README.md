# software-house-challenge
An app developed for the Software House challenge, a "clone" of the tiktok home page.


## Features
* [X] A video feed where each video occupies the full area of the screen and can be swiped up and down with the same edge-to-edge (peeking) gesture as TikTok.
* [X] Videos should loop indefinitely if kept on screen.
* [X] The profile picture of the poster as well as the video title should be displayed over each video.
* [X] The user should be able to react to the video with the heart on the left side and/or fire on the right side.
* [X] The user can react multiple times on a given video and the count should show under the reaction emoji. (Much like the clap mechanism on Medium.)
* [X] The emoji icons themselves should be tappable. (Tapping should increase the reaction count)
* [X] The user should be able to react by side swiping on the screen. The direction of the swipe (left or right) determines which emoji the user is reacting with. This too, should increase the count.
* [X] Video for feed should use the provided JSON object.
